## Why contribute to Open Source?
There is a great article here on this subject, but [here](https://www.devx.com/open-source-zone/top-10-reasons-your-company-should-contribute-to-open-source-projects/) is a summary:

A company that contributes to open source shows that they are committed to the development community, which raises their reputation as an innovative company and leads to being able to hire the best engineers. There is also a great feeling of accomplishment when contributing to open source, especially in a large project. Your code could be used by thousands of institutions and companies all around the world and be the backbone for millions of products. Along with code contribution comes influence in products, where you may be asked your opinion on an implementation of your code that you had never considered. Contributing to open source opens a lot of doors for the people and companies who participate in it.
