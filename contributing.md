# Contributing

## Introduction
First, we here at T-Mobile would like to thank you for contributing to our Open Source project. It is very much appreciated. Before we do get started, however, we’d like to cover some ground rules and asks that we have for contributing.

<br>

## Look for Duplicates

If you could please look to see in the issues section if there are any submissions that already exist for your bug, feature request, documentation request, etc. we’d greatly appreciate it. If you do see an already existing submission, please feel free to add to it. 

If an issue does not exist, however, please feel free to add it. 

> NOTE: If you find a Closed issue that seems like it is the same thing that you're experiencing, open a new issue and include a link to the original issue in the body of your new one.

<br>

## Cosmetic Changes
Note that this project does not accept code changes that are mostly cosmetic in nature. We understand that you are working hard to make the code more readable, adding or removing white space in the code, however, we feel that if the contribution is not significantly adding to the stability, functionality, or testability of the repository, the change is not necessary.

<br>

## Significant Changes
If you plan on making a significant code change, it's always a good idea to reach out to T-Mobile before starting. We can be reached at ______________.

<br>

## Larger Submission Break Down
If you do plan on making a significant change, please consider breaking your large submissions into smaller changes. Try and keep your changes short (<100 lines of code if possible). If you can't do this, try submitting it as several smaller issues rather than a large one.

   - Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...").
   - Limit the first line to 72 characters or less.
   - Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line.
3. Please find an example of the pull request markdown in case you cannot get to the link above:
